Some basic information include, early education focusing on skills like writing, mathematics, and philosophy, often being reserved for elites. 


To earn a Bachelor’s degree, students typically complete 12 years of primary and secondary education, followed by 3-4 years of undergraduate study at a college or university. This involves choosing a major, completing general education requirements, and earning a set number of credits through coursework, exams, and projects. Many programs also include internships or research opportunities. A Bachelor’s degree equips graduates with specialized knowledge, critical thinking skills, and better career prospects, serving as a foundation for advanced studies or professional success.

The data for this project came from the America Community survey.

# American Community Survey (ACS)

The **American Community Survey (ACS)** is an ongoing survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides vital information about the nation's population, housing, and economy. Unlike the decennial census, which counts the population every 10 years, the ACS collects data annually, offering more frequent and detailed insights into American life.

## Purpose and Scope
The ACS aims to help communities, policymakers, and businesses make informed decisions by providing up-to-date statistics on topics such as:
- Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, education)
- Economic indicators (income, employment, poverty)
- Housing trends (homeownership, rent, housing costs)
- Social factors (marital status, disability, transportation)

## Methodology
The survey reaches approximately 3.5 million households each year, sampling a small percentage of the population. Data is collected through online forms, mail, phone calls, and in-person interviews. The ACS produces **1-year**, **3-year**, and **5-year estimates**, with the 5-year estimates offering the most comprehensive data for smaller geographic areas.

## Impact
The ACS is a critical tool for allocating federal funds, planning community services, and addressing social and economic challenges. Its data is widely used by governments, researchers, and businesses to understand trends and disparities across the United States.
