 The map displays the percentage of residents with doctorate degrees across different neighborhoods in Tampa and surrounding areas. The legend indicates percentages ranging from 0-6%, with purple representing the lowest rates (0-1%) and yellow representing the highest rates (around 6%).

Most of the mapped area shows deep purple coloring, indicating that the vast majority of neighborhoods have very low percentages of residents with doctorate degrees (0-1%). There are a few notable exceptions where small pockets show higher concentrations:
A few scattered areas display green coloring (around 3-4%), particularly in the central part of Tampa and near the airport area. There are also one or two very small yellow spots showing the highest concentration of doctorate holders (5-6%).
